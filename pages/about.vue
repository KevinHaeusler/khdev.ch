          Hello My name is Kevin HÃ¤usler and this is my project showcase /
          learning documentation / knowledge sharing website.
        </p>
        <p>
          I finished an apprentice ship in switzerland as Informatiker (System
          Engineer), currently my job description would be a mix between first
          and second level support, firewall and windows server maintenance and
          creating/updating wordpress websites with aio themes like divi.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time I like to cook, grow hot peppers and try out new
          exciting technology based things. Currently it is webdevelopment,
          python and machine learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next year I will hopefully start a bachelor study in AI &
          Machinelearning.
